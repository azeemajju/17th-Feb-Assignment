    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database system that is designed to be scalable, flexible, and easy to use. It stores data in a document format, typically in the BSON format (Binary JSON), which is a binary representation of JSON data. MongoDB is a popular choice for modern web applications that require fast and flexible data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional table-based structure of relational databases. Instead, they use various data models, such as key-value, document-oriented, or graph databases, to store and manage data. Non-relational databases offer benefits such as scalability, high availability, and performance, and they are often used in modern web applications that require flexibility and agility.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility and scalability are important: MongoDB can handle large amounts of unstructured data and can easily scale horizontally across multiple nodes, making it a good choice for applications that need to handle a large volume of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rapid development: MongoDB's document-based data model allows for faster development and iteration, as changes to the data schema do not require the same level of planning and coordination as they do in a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile methodologies: MongoDB's flexible data model makes it easier to accommodate changes in requirements or data structure, making it a good fit for agile development methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex queries: MongoDB's native support for rich, nested queries makes it well-suited for applications that require complex queries, such as geospatial queries or text search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big data: MongoDB is often used in big data applications, where it can handle the large volumes of data generated by modern applications and analytics platforms."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:MongoDB has several features that make it a popular choice for modern web applications. Here are some of its key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. This makes it easy to store and retrieve data that does not fit into a rigid table structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple nodes, allowing it to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads. It can be easily configured for sharding, replication, and load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB supports various types of indexing, including single-field, compound, and geospatial indexes. This allows for fast and efficient querying of large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation framework: MongoDB's aggregation framework allows for complex data analysis and aggregation operations to be performed in the database. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred to the application and can improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ad hoc queries: MongoDB allows for ad hoc queries to be performed on the data without the need to define a schema or structure in advance. This makes it easy to prototype and experiment with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support for multiple data models: MongoDB supports multiple data models, including document-based, key-value, and graph databases. This allows it to be used in a wide range of applications and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic schema: MongoDB allows for dynamic schema changes, meaning fields can be added or removed from documents without the need for a schema update. This can make development faster and more agile.\n",
    "\n",
    "High availability: MongoDB supports automatic failover and replication, making it highly available and resilient to system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB's features make it a flexible and scalable choice for modern web applications that require fast and efficient data storage and retrieval."
